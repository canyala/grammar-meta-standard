# Grammar Meta Standard

This repository defines a structured way to describe programming languages and versions using formal grammars (e.g. EBNF). It aims to enable high-precision code generation and analysis across language versions.

## Structure

- `grammars/`: Contains grammars for each language and version
- `meta/`: Metadata definitions and change tracking
- `tools/`: Utilities such as grammar diffing, validation, and conversion

## Motivation

Programming languages are governed by strict rules. Large language models and tools that work with code should operate with equally strict understanding. This project is an initiative to define, version, and share grammar specifications in accessible, precise, and programmable ways.
